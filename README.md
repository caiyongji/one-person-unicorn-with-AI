# Why this
### Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, says:
> The thing that, in my little groupchat with my tech CEO friends, thereâ€™s this betting pool for the first year that there is a one person billion dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI and now it will happen. [[From X post]](https://x.com/caiyongji/status/1765724316635971846?s=20)

### Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, says:
> You now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do to help automate your work, to amplify your productivity, to make you more efficient. And so, I think that this is just a tremendous time. The impact of course is great and your imperative to activate and take advantage of the technology is absolutely immediate. And also to realize that to engage AI is a lot easier now than at any time in the history of computing. It is vital that we upskill everyone and the upskilling process, I believe, will be delightful, surprising, to realize that this computer can perform all these things that you're instructing it to do and doing it so easily.
